this is where I will make a visualization demonstrating the correlation of ranking and hype score
```{r}
ggplot(merged_book, aes(x= averagescore, y=Rank)) + geom_point()
```
```{r}
bookrankcor <- cor(merged_book$averagescore, merged_book$Rank)

# Print the correlation coefficient
print(bookrankcor)
```
```{r}
rankmodel <- lm(Rank ~ averagescore, data = merged_book)
summary(rankmodel)
```
