    "text": "Dataset\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readr)\nTop_100_Trending_Books &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Top-100 Trending Books.csv\")\n# View(Top_100_Trending_Books)\n\n\nUsing a combination of scraped data from amazon’s top 100 bestsellers and data collected myself, I will graphically demonstrate how presence on social media impacts a books rating and ranking.\nThe first data set is a pre-scraped data-set I found on “Kaggle”. It took the top 100 bestselling books for Amazon at the time (November 2023) and placed them on a data frame. Some important variables include book name, author, price, rating and genre. There are 100 observations with each observation being a from the bestsellers list. The data comma-separated value file already comes in ranked order.\n\nThe second component of data is one I collect myself. I am going to put out a Google form where those who frequently involved in book social media communities can answer some questions. The data from the Google form will all be accessed via Google spreadsheet. This spreadsheet can be easily turned into a csv file that I will open in R-studio.\n\n\nAbove are some examples of what the Google form might look like and how it would collect data. The first image shows a binary scale, which is not how I decided to collect data. That is purely just an example.\n\nIn order to maintain a tidy format I will be using the multiple choice grid option of the Google forms. This will also make things easier for those filling out the Google form.\nFor genre I will have one question dedicated to asking about genres are the most prevalent on online readings spheres. I will ask about each genre specifically and how prominent the genre is on social media on a 0-2 scale. I will assign the numerical values in r-studio. Those filling out the form will not see the numerical values.\n\n0 means no social media presence.\n1 means some social media presence.\n2 means a high social media presence.\n\nI wanted to next hone in on specific authors and books and ask if each book individually has a social media presence. Like with genre above I will go by book individually.\nOne question will be dedicated to determining what online reading spaces specifically a person frequents. Not only will this reveal the demographics of those filling out the form. I will be able to decipher if some books are more hyped on some platforms than others.\n\n\nThe reason why I am going so far as to collect my own data is because attempting to find data about online book trends is difficult with so many having different user experiences. I attempted to access the Tik-Tok API, but unfortunately I do not meet the credentials necessary to have access to free content data. Other social media platforms had similar challenges. I have always had an assumption that social media has impacted what products are popular. I myself frequent these platforms and would be interested in what the data actually does say.\nIn order to collect data, I will need responses. My questionnaire will be really open to anybody, but I am asking for anybody who is active on online book communities. Reed College students has a student body that notoriously loves reading. I believe there might be a population of students active on online book communities here at Reed College. My plan is to launch the completed Google form by April 7th through April 14th. It will be publicly viewed on the Reed College Student Body newsletters I plan to put up posters with QR codes by the 30th. If responses are slow, I need to incentive with a gift card or hold a table outside commons. My goal is at least 50 response by April 11th.\nApril 5th-11th is dedicated to data collection and also tidying up the current “Top_100_Trending_Books” That data set is almost in a preferred tidy format except for the genre column. If a book follows multiple genre’s then all the genre’s are listed. I intend to use a pivot function, when analyzing on the basis of genre. Previous visualizations (on Kaggle) did not take the untidy aspect of the data into account.\nApril 12th-15th hopefully all the data collection is complete and turned into a csv file. All data at this point will be stored in a designated data folder. I will then calculated the average scores by genre, book and author of social media presence. Books that have an average score between 0-1 and 1-2 will be separated into books without a social media presence and books with a social media presence respectably. Once separated into the new groups, I will make visualizations that compares the average ratings and ranking by social media status.\nAfter being peer-reviewed, I will make the appropriate changes and start prepping for the presentation\nSome folders I’ve added is the already mentioned data folder, a folder for me tidying the Top_100_Trending_books and collected data, a folder explicitly for all visualizations."

    "text": "Introduction :\nWhat does reading look like in 2024? Scroll enough on a social media platform and one might stumble on a young adult raving about their favorite book. They might be sharing they favorite book tropes or rating their recent reads. These online bookish spaces also allow for a different type of content: hauls. Creators going to stores and splurging on books that they never share reviews on. Their content becomes focused on the special editions of books rather than the substance inside them. Bookshelf tours rather than comprehensive ratings.\nI do not want to give the impression that I have an overall cynical view of online book spaces, I just spend a lot of free time on there. I see much of the same books, authors, tropes, and genre’s recommended over and over. In this era of consumption, I do wonder if the hype, the buzz and level of discussion of a book actually makes an impact?\nThrough Kaggle (a data science competition platform and online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners under Google LLC) I found a scrapped data frame made by a user. This was a data frame of Amazon’s top 100 bestselling books of 2023 made Ansh Tanwar. Some variables of note in this data set were the title, author, genre, (variable saved in a list separated by commas), book rating, and book ranking.\nAll this was important data to have on hand, but what I really wanted was to compare this data to one a lot more difficult to calculate. I wanted to connect a book’s presence online to it’s rating or even it’s overall ranking on amazon. I decided that I would create a questionnaire and use input from those active on bookish social media to give books a presence rating. Small note, collecting data this way was an from using API’s directly from social media platforms. I did not have the appropriate credentials to request API usage or it would cost a fee I could not pay.\nThis approach part of this write-up will tackle both the data-collection portion and what I decided to do with the data once I had the data.\nQuestion 1:\nHow does a book’s/genre’s social media presence impact book sales/ratings?\n\nApproach (Data Collection):\n\nglimpse(bookishdata_sm)\n\nRows: 33\nColumns: 9\n$ Timestamp       &lt;chr&gt; \"4/8/2024 22:59:06\", \"4/10/2024 13:51:03\", \"4/10/2024 …\n$ `Email Address` &lt;chr&gt; \"rons@reed.edu\", \"durkinm@reed.edu\", \"rkhediri@reed.ed…\n$ sm_tok          &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, …\n$ sm_tube         &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, …\n$ sm_gram         &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, …\n$ sm_good         &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, …\n$ sm_red          &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ sm_tumb         &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ sm_oth          &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, …\n\n\nWhen it came to the data collection portion of my project, I made the style of the questions with the intention of making the subsequent data frame as tidy as possible. The above data frame is just an example of how I collected data.\n\nThe above question shows the format of the entirety of my questionnaire. There would be a set number of possible responses an a variety of categories of a question. This way of asking actually made response collection relatively quick despite the 200+ questions. I would convert the responses to numerical variables as needed.\nIf you would like to view the questionnaire from the perspective as one of the people I collected data from, here is the link to view this form: https://forms.gle/oqg772SjDWP5c41J6\nTo give every individual user an ID, I did keep their email and time stamp of the response.\nAs far as data collection goes, the avenues I was counting on to get eyes on my project were delayed to a student death on campus, so that aspect of my project was prolonged. I did use posters, student newsletters, and word of mouth to get as many responses as possible. I also had to offer 20 of my own dollars to get my interaction as well. After all of this I did have 33 responses, which was enough to continue my project.\nWhy did I rely on Reed college students? Despite them being accessible to me, I also was looking for a demographic that would have associations on online book platforms. This type of person would have to be interested in reading as a hobby), but also have some sort of online proficiency. I believed that a younger demographic would capture that more as young adults are typically going to have a social media presence. Reedies also do have a strong capacity for reading in general. I believed targeting Reed college would garner results that represented my demographic fairly well, but also would give me enough responses to be able to learn something from the data.\nThe methodology behind my questions was very much structured after the Amazon’s bestsellers list. Every single book in the Amazon’s Top 100 was asked about in terms of social media presence. I used a slightly different metric of measurement for sm_type and the other two major questions. sm_type I wanted more of a binary, I am active here or not, meanwhile for the other question I wanted more of a scale, since social media presence was the objective of the entire questionnaire.\n\nBook Questionnaire Codebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable:\nQuestion:\nResponse:\nVariants:\n\n\n\n\nsmtype\nWhat online book communities are you active in (as a creator or viewer)?\n0: No, I’m not active in this community.\n1: Yes, I’m active in this community\nsm_tok= Tik-Tok(booktok)\nsm_tube=\nbooktube(youtube)\nsm_gram=\nbookgram(booktube)\nsm_good=\nGoodreads\nsm_red= Reddit\nsm_tumb=Tumblr\nsm_oth= Other Book Centered Website/App\n\n\ngenre\nWhat kind of Social Media presence do the following categories, topics, or genres have on your book-related feed?\n0: No Social Media Presence\n1: Some Social Media Presence\n2: High Social Media Presence\ngenre_(category, genre, topic name)\nEx. genre_bib=Biblical Studies - Prophecy, Christian Theology - Eschatolog\n\n\nbook\nWhat kind of Social Media presence do the following book/series have on your book-related feed?\n0: No Social Media Presence\n1: Some Social Media Presence\n2: High Social Media Presence\nbooktitle by bookauthor\n\n\n\nNote: there was not present Codebook for the scrapped dataset.\nIn the data frame from Kaggle, Author and book title were separated, but I opted to combine them in case someone filling out the questionnaire recognized one and not the other. This could help inform how they would answer the question and how they were measure social media presence. I also reverted this back after data collection. It was very important the genre and book titles completely matched the Amazon’s bestseller’s list because I wanted to merge them together to put “presence score” on a scatterplot with rating or ranking. This presence score would be collected from averaging all the responses of social media presence and putting it on a scale between 0-2. Anything between 0-1 would mean the book/genre in question has no/some social media presence, while between 1-2 would mean some social media presence and high social media presence.\nWith the scrapped data I found it was not in a tidy format, so I had to do that work myself with genre. Interestingly I found, one of the authors was recorded as Unknown even though the page it was scrapped from had an author. The author was Ted Cruz, the Republican Governor of Texas known for being hyper-conservative. I do believe this data scientist probably tampered to omit their name, but kept their book on the list.

I did however find a connection by genre. There was the statically significant correlation being social media presence and genre. Genre was calculated with how frequent it appeared on the Amazon’s bestsellers list. The null in this instance was that there is no correlation between social media presence and proportion of amazon’s bestselling list. Since, the p-value was roughly .025, means that I must reject the null and the alternative hypothesis is true. There is a correlation between social media presence and a genre’s proportion of amazon’s bestselling list. The frequency a genre a spoken about online increases the likelihood that genre will emerge in top book sales.\nHowever a lot of these results can just aid themselves to the truth that some genre’s are just more popular than others. Social media may not be making these genre’s gain success in sales, but rather the genre themselves just garner more engagement.\nI also cannot ignore the possibility for bias by those who self selected to partake in the questionnaire. Those who took this survey might have heightened or exaggerated opinions about books and their presence online. Also this questionnaire was exclusive to Reed College students and that might be a confounding variable as well. I can not apply the results of this questionnaire to the whole population on bookish online spaces, just those who also attend Reed college.\nI will also not how I dropped my focus on social media. It was interesting to glean the results of what online spaces were most present in my questionnaire, but it had no impact overall on my central question, so I dropped it from my write up.\nI underestimated the popularity of children’s books, whose demographic are not on online book platforms. Children and their parents may learn about new books from word of mouth and not necessarily by engaging online. There can be some overlap between parents and book centered social media, but not much."

I did multiple regession analsyis tests and visualizations based on both rating and ranking on Amazon’s Bestseller’s List and if anything the weak correlations were negative.\nI do not believe that this project was in vain. When I was somewhat fruitless in my project, I did consider changing the course of my project to do more predictive modeling based one the type of social media people were active on or how frequent they were online. Just because I did not find a strong correlation does not mean that this project was a waste. In fact, I would argue the opposite. I see the results as somewhat hopeful. Readers are not mindless who will buy whatever is advertised. The hype surrounding books is not enough to cause a book to skyrocket in sales. Substance is also considered. Overall this project showed that the growing “aesthetic of reading” does not trump the craft of writing."
