here I will sort collected data into two groups; books, genres and authors with a social media presence and those without.
```{r}

# Pivot the data frame
genre_averages <- bookishdata_genre1 %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -c(Timestamp, `Email Address`), names_to = "genre", values_to = "value") %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarise(
    average = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE),
    low = quantile(value, 0.1, na.rm = TRUE),
    high = quantile(value, 0.9, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

```
